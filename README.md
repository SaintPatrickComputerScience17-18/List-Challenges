# List-Challenges

See the worksheet from class for definitions of each question.

1.  Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.
2.  Write function that reverses a list, preferably in place.
3.  Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a list.
4.  Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list.
5.  Write a function that computes the running total of a list.
6.  Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
7.  Write a function that computes the sum of the numbers in a list using recursion.
8.  Write a function that concatenates two lists.  [a,b,c] ,  [1,2,3]  →  [a,b,c,1,2,3]
9.  Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g.  [a,b,c] ,  [1,2,3]  →  [a,1,b,2,c,3] .
10.  Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list. [1,4,6] , [2,3,5]  →  [1,2,3,4,5,6] .
11.  Write a function that rotates a list by  k  elements. For example  [1,2,3,4,5,6]  rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2] . This can be done with or without creating a copy of the list.
12.  Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.
